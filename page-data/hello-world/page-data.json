Generate ssh keys.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"> $ ssh-keygen <span class=\"token parameter variable\">-C</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"youremail@email.com\"</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Now that command generates a pair of public and private keys in your <code class=\"language-text\">~/.ssh</code> directory and asks you to provide the name. By default, the name is <code class=\"language-text\">id_rsa.pub</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">id_rsa</code> for public and private keys respectively.</p>\n<p>We will generate two pairs of keys each for GitHub and GitLab and name them id_rsa_github and id_rsa_gitlab respectively.</p>\n<p>Now your <code class=\"language-text\">~/.ssh</code> should look like</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">|__ id_rsa_gitlab\n|__ id_rsa_gitlab.pub\n|__ id_rsa_github\n|__ id_rsa_github.pub</code></pre></div>\n<p>Step 2. Add the respective public key to the respective provider(GitLab and GitHub)</p>\n<p>Step 3. <em>Now comes the important part</em>. How to make ssh-client know which key to use when pushed to GitHub or GitLab? ðŸ¤”</p>\n<p>So we can have a <code class=\"language-text\">config</code> file which will help ssh-client to solve the problem.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> ~/.ssh/config <span class=\"token comment\"># we are creating a config file using touch utility. You can create the same in whatever way you want</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Letâ€™s see what to put in the config file.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Host github.com\nHostName github.com\nPreferredAuthentications publickey\nIdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github\n\nHost gitlab.com\nHostName gitlab.com\nPreferredAuthentications publickey\nIdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_gitlab</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here, we are basically telling ssh-client which ssh private key to use based on the provider.\nSo whenever we try to push to our GitHub repo it will automatically use the GitHub key and we wonâ€™t have any trouble handling multiple keys. ðŸ˜Ž</p>\n<p>If you face any problem in implementing this, let me know in the comments. I Will be happy to resolve.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading ðŸ˜€</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Managing different SSH keys for GitLab and GitHub on your System.","date":"October 10, 2022","description":"In this blog I will show you how to manage multiple ssh keys on your system"}},"previous":null,"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"18fc4fe9-0e89-59ce-8872-949d1f306088","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
